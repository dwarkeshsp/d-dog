As a side project, I am planning on building an IPFS-like protocol from scratch.

> The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with contentaddressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.

Got that? Yeah, neither did I. But there would be no point to this project if I already understood how distributed hashtables and incentivized block exchanges work. And what I mean by 'understand' is contained by the aphorism, "If you can't code it, you don't understand it."

My goal is not to write up something that could actually interact with other IPFS objects in the world with their specific specs. I only want to build a prototype which successfully employs the important concepts from IPFS.

I want to break apart this project into distinct and independent subtasks.

As far as I can tell, and again it's not very far, I can split this project into the following steps:

1. Build a Merkle DAG file system which supports versioning
2. Build a Kademlia distributed hash table for finding files
3. Build an incentivized block exchange protocol
