If you know the hash of a previous commit, how do you find the hash of the next commit on the same object? 

Is there a way to create machine ID such that their XOR distance is correlated with their actual distance? This would speed up communication to nodes closeby. If you created machine IDs as Kademlia paper and Chord describe (by hashing the IP address), closer machines would not have a closer ID. You could just use the raw IP address but this raises privacy concerns.

What prevents a node from lying about its public key so that it looks like another node?

I can imagine a distributed ledger which notes how much each person has contributed to seeding stuff in general and then create a system where people deliver files to these altruists first. But I can also imagine a system where where people keep track of who has helped them personally and help those people first. The first is like trade with currency and the latter is like barter. Which is preferable?

How many peers does IPFS or another p2p protocol need before it has as much or lower latency than centralized servers? Is the bottleneck finding a seeder or using the seeder's slow upload
